# Read CSV Files into Data frames 

Data Files are sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-music-recommendation-challenge/data. The files train.csv, songs.csv, test.csv and train.csv have been downloaded and saved into local drive.

```{r   message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#Reading the train data set,
#train <- as.tibble(read_csv('train.csv'))
train <- fread('train.csv', encoding= "UTF-8", verbose=FALSE)
#Reading the test data set,
#test <- as.tibble(read_csv('test.csv'))
test <- fread('test.csv', encoding= "UTF-8", verbose=FALSE)
#Reading the members data set,
#members <- as.tibble(read_csv('members.csv'))
members <- fread('members.csv', encoding= "UTF-8", verbose=FALSE)
#Reading the songs data set,
#songs <- as.tibble(read_csv('songs.csv'))
songs <- fread('songs.csv', encoding= "UTF-8", verbose=FALSE)
```

# Insert CSV files into MySQL Tables

```{r eval = FALSE}
mydb <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user='data607', password='testpassword', dbname='music', host='localhost')

dbSendQuery(mydb, "LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'members.csv'
                  INTO TABLE members
                  FIELDS TERMINATED by ','
                  LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
                  IGNORE 1 LINES");

dbSendQuery(mydb, "LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'train.csv'
                  INTO TABLE train
                  FIELDS TERMINATED by ','
                  LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
                  IGNORE 1 LINES");


dbSendQuery(mydb, "LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'test.csv'
                  INTO TABLE test
                  FIELDS TERMINATED by ','
                  LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
                  IGNORE 1 LINES");

# EDA


```{r}
#ins_query <- "INSERT INTO songs(song_id, song_length, genre_ids,language) VALUES (songs$song_id, songs$song_length, songs$genre_ids,songs$language)";

#sqlExecute(mydb, ins_query, songs) ;

#remove(train)

```


#### Top Artists

```{r top artist}
artist_cnt <- top(songs, "artist_name")
```

#### Top Lyricists

```{r top lyricist}
lyricist_count <- top(songs, "lyricist")
```

#### Top composers

```{r top composer}
composer_count <- top(songs, "composer")
```

#### Top Language

```{r top language}
language_count <- top(songs, "language")
```


```{r}
art_lyr<- sum(songs$artist_name == songs$lyricist)
lyr_com <- sum(songs$lyricist == songs$composer)
art_com <- sum(songs$artist_name == songs$composer)

```

`r art_lyr` songs have same artist and lyricist name.  
`r lyr_com` songs have same lyricist and composer name.     
`r art_com` songs have same artist and composer name.   

```{r}
glimpse(songs)
```

Genre_id is a multi label column with a minumum label of 'one' to a maximum label of 'eight'. There are 192 unique genres. There are some missing values as well.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

genids <- songs %>% 
  separate(genre_ids, 
           c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight"), 
           extra="merge")

genre_cnt <- genids %>% 
  select(one:eight) %>% 
  gather(one:eight, key="nth_id", value="genre_ids", na.rm=TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(genre_ids) %>% count %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% print()

```

##### Analysis of 'song_length'
```{r}
(min(songs$song_length)/1000)/60;(max(songs$song_length)/1000)/60

```

```{r}
#Records that have more than 15 minutes
 subset(songs, ((songs$song_length/1000)/60) > 15) %>% count
```


Song length range from 0.003 minutes to 202.89 minutes. There are 13623 records that have length more than 15 minutes.  

```{r song length dist, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
songs %>% 
  mutate(song_length = song_length/6e4) %>%   ggplot(aes(song_length)) +   geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, fill='darkolivegreen') +
  labs(x='Song Length', y = 'Frequency', title = 'Distribution of song length') +   xlim(0, 15)
```


## MEMBERS

Let's look at the members df,

```{r display members, echo=FALSE}
glimpse(members)
```

In members data fram, city, bd, gender, registered via are categorical and registration init and expiration date are dates.


```{r}
city_1<-subset(members, city==1)
age_0 <- subset(members,bd==0)

```

The functions memb_colgrp and memb_dt_cnt are defined as follows

```{r members function}
memb_colgrp <- function(df,col_name, x, y, title, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
                    {
                      
                    temp_df <- df %>% group_by_(col_name) %>% count() %>% arrange(desc(n))
                    
                    df_plot <- temp_df %>% ggplot(aes_string(col_name, "n")) + geom_col(fill='goldenrod2') + 
                                    labs(x = x, y = y, title = title) + xlim(xmin, xmax) +  ylim(ymin, ymax) + readble_labels
                    
                    print(df_plot)
                    return(temp_df)

}

memb_dt_cnt <- function(df, col_name, x, y, title)
{
                            df %>%   group_by_(month = month(col_name), year = year(col_name)) %>% 
                                count() %>% ungroup %>% 
                                mutate(date = as.Date(paste(as.character(year), as.character(month), '01', sep='-')))
                                ggplot(aes(date, n))+ geom_line(color='goldenrod2', size=1) +
                                labs(x = x,  y = y, title= title) +
                                xlim(xmin, xmax) +  readble_labels
}


```

### Distribution of city, bd(age), gender {.tabset}

#### City
```{r}
glimpse(city_1)
```


```{r}
members%>%group_by(city)%>%count
```


The value '1' have the most count. But the number 19445 seems suspicious as it is close to the number of records with zero age.  
City = 1 is also far from other city counts.  

#### Age

```{r}

glimpse(age_0)

```

There are observations with age greater than 1000 and there are observations with age less than or equal to  0 and those are ouliers as described in the data dictionary. Sorted bd vs Frequency is shown in the tibble as well as the plot.  There are 19932 records with 0 as age. This could be either outliers or missing values.  
Plotting in the age range 1 -100 to show the real distribution.  


```{r age tab, warning=TRUE}
memb_colgrp(members, "bd", "Age", "Frequency", "Age Distribution", 1, 100, 0, 1000)
```

#### Gender

As we see the counts of 'target' values in the train data frame, in members, the Male and female counts are almost equal. We have a lot of missing gender (19902).
```{r gender tab, warning=TRUE}
members %>% group_by(gender) %>%  count
```


#### Registered_via
```{r}
members %>% group_by(registered_via)%>% count
```

Registration methods seem to be dominated mainly by 4,7,9 and 3

Convert the data types of the variables 'registration_init_time' and 'expiration_date' from int to date.

```{r date conversion}
# This is one of the items in the checklist. ymd is used to convert
members %<>%  mutate(registration_init_time = ymd(registration_init_time),
                     expiration_date = ymd(expiration_date))
glimpse(members)  # Notice the changes inthe data type
```

### Signup vs Expiration 

There are  members signed up in 2004. But mostly users signed up between later part of 2016 and early part of 2017. 

```{r signup vs expiration, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

registration_cnt <- members %>% 
    group_by(month = month(registration_init_time), year = year(registration_init_time)) %>% 
    count() %>%  ungroup %>%  
   mutate(date = as.Date(paste(as.character(year), as.character(month), '01', sep='-'))) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%  print

expiration_count <- members %>% 
    group_by(month = month(expiration_date), year = year(expiration_date)) %>% 
    count() %>% ungroup %>% 
    mutate(date = as.Date(paste(as.character(year), as.character(month), '01', sep='-'))) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%  print

registration_cnt %>% 
  left_join(expiration_count, by="date") %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_line(aes(date, n.x), color='goldenrod2') +
  geom_line(aes(date, n.y), color='mediumorchid') +
  labs(y="Frequency", title="Registration and Expiration Distribution")+
  readble_labels
  
```

### Missingness in members

For City == 1, the values of gender and age shows that there are missing values. There are 18516 records that match all three condition. There is certainly relationship between these missingness.  

```{r members missingness}
members %>% 
  mutate(cit_gen_age = if_else(((city == 1) & (bd == 0) & (gender == "")), 1, 0),
         cit_gen =  if_else(((city == 1) & (gender == "")), 1, 0),
         cit_age = if_else(((city == 1) & (bd == 0)), 1, 0),
         gen_age =  if_else(((bd == 0) & (gender == "")), 1, 0)) %>% 
  summarize(city_gender_age = sum(cit_gen_age),
            city_gender = sum(cit_gen),
            city_age = sum(cit_age),
            gender_age =sum(gen_age))
```



## TEST

Compare the test and train data frames.

### Distribution of test and train on columns {.tabset}

```{r}
train_test_graph <- function(train, test, col_name, x, y)
  {
  test %>%  group_by_(col_name) %>%   summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  left_join(train %>% group_by_(col_name) %>% summarize(count = n()) , by=col_name) %>% 
  mutate(ratio = count.x/count.y) %>% 
  rename(test_cnt = count.x, train_cnt = count.y) %>% 
  arrange(ratio) %>%   print %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes_string(col_name, "train_cnt"), fill='brown', alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_col(aes_string(col_name, "test_cnt"), fill='blue', alpha = 0.5) +
  coord_flip() +  labs(x = x, y= y)+  readble_labels
}
```

#### Source_system_tab

Train had more records from with value 'my library' compared to test.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

x<-'source system tab'
y<-'Test/Train record Count'

test %>%  group_by_("source_system_tab") %>%   summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  left_join(train %>% group_by_("source_system_tab") %>% summarize(count = n()) , by='source_system_tab') %>% 
  mutate(ratio = count.x/count.y) %>% 
  rename(test_cnt = count.x, train_cnt = count.y) %>% 
  arrange(ratio) %>%   print

```


#### Source_screen_name

```{r}
train_test_graph(train, test, col_name = "source_screen_name", "Source Screen Name", "Test/Train Count")
```

# Feature Engineering

## Songs Features

Features in the song data frame that shows the frequency of a particular item in the data set.

```{r}
# <> is from magrittr package that is used for assiging it back the result
songs %<>% 
  left_join(artist_cnt, by='artist_name') %>% left_join(lyricist_count, by='lyricist') %>% 
  left_join(composer_count, by='composer') %>%  left_join(language_count, by='language') %>% 
  rename(art_cnt = n.x, lyr_cnt = n.y, cmp_cnt = n.x.x, lng_cnt = n.y.y)

glimpse(songs)
```
